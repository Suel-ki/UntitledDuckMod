This release adds support for minecraft 1.18.2 on both fabric and forge again.
It introduces configuration support for the spawn rate/weight which you can change now.
Additionally, most of the annoying bugs were fixed now which is why I am going to release this as v1.0 soon.

Thanks for playing and providing your feedback!
